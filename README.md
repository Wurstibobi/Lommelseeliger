# Lommelseeliger
A program that uses the Lommel-seeliger method to calculate the integrated brightness of an ellipsoid. Used to compare the brightness of solar system asteroids as a function of their phase angle. We triangulate the ellipsoid and calculate brightness for each triangle and sum them up, depending on the location of our light source and observer.
